# Pomodoro Timer
## What is a Pomodoro Timer?
The idea of a pomodoro timer is to:
1. Work for 25 minutes
2. Break for 10 minutes
3. Repeat back to step 1, two more times
4. Work for 25 more minutes
5. Rest for 30 minutes
6. Repeat back to step 1, if you so please

## Program
The user interface (UI) is made using the Tkinter module.
The timer is made by refreshing the value every 1000 ms (1 second).
The tomato image is just a PNG file, but can be switched to any image.
