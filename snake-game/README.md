# Snake Game
This game is a remake of the original snake game. Each time the snake eats a berry, then the snake grows longer. If the snake hits a wall or hits it's tail, then the game is over.

## Program
The snake and food are made using the turtle module.
1. The snake will start off with a size of 3, and will continue moving.
2. A random food will spawn
3. If the snake gets the food, the score and length of the snake increases by 1.
4. If the snake hits a wall or it's tail then game over and the game resets.
